## Initialization

Initialization is the process of assigning an initial value to a variable. It occurs after the variable has been declared. Initializing a variable gives it an initial value so that it has a valid and predictable state when used in subsequent code. The initial value can be specified at the time of declaration or at a later point in the program.

```c
x = 5;
```

## Declaration

Declaration refers to the act of introducing a variable to the compiler or interpreter, indicating the variable's name and type. It informs the compiler or interpreter that a variable with a specific name and type will be used in the program. Declaration reserves memory for the variable but does not assign it a value. It allows the program to recognize and allocate memory for the variable before it is used.

```c
int x;
```

## Definition

Definition combines the process of declaration and initialization into a single step. It introduces a variable, specifies its type, and assigns an initial value. It includes both reserving memory for the variable and assigning it an initial value. A defined variable is ready to be used in subsequent code.

```c
int x = 5;
```
